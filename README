These are the firmware files used by the hdsploader utility.  They are
necessary when using the RME Hammerfall Multiface II PCIe card and box:

The hdsploader utility is part of the alsa-firmware-loaders Debian
package, but the firmware files are apparently nowhere to be found
these days, so I've uploaded them here.  The two files should be
installed like this so that hdsploader can find them:

/usr/lib/firmware/hdsploader/multiface_firmware.bin
/usr/lib/firmware/hdsploader/multiface_firmware_rev11.bin
